#Quiz App 
This is a simple Quiz App built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON and AJAX. The Quiz App is designed to load questions from a JSON file, display them to the user, and evaluate the user's answers.

The App displays one question at a time, and the user must select one of four possible answers. After the user has answered a question, the App evaluates the answer, displays the correct answer, and moves on to the next question.

#Prerequisites

Running the tests
